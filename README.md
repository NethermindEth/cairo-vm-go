# Cairo VM in Go

> :warning: This project is still in it's infancy. Contributions are welcomed!

This projects aims to implement the Cairo Virtual Machine in Go. This kind of tool is the one that Starknet nodes use to execute and prove transactions. Up to this point there have been several implementations of the vm:

* cairo-lang on python by Starkware
* three implementations of the VM in rust, go and c by LambdaClass

Having several implementations helps the ecosystem by making the net bug resistant (what is the chance that a same vm bug happens accross several vms) and offering choice to users.
