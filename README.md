# Cairo VM in Go

> ⚠️  This project is undergoing heavy development and is still on its early stages. There will be constant breaking changes.

This project aims to implement a Cairo Virtual Machine using Go. This is one of [many other](#related-projects) implementations that are being developed and its main goals are:

* making the Starknet ecosystem secure by reducing the risk of a single critical vulnerability,
* decentralizing development and maintenance of the different VMs,
* cross-checking and validation with other implementations and
* to foster innovation through competition.

## Intro

The Cairo Virtual Machine is a crucial component of the Starknet ecosystem. It serves as the runtime environment for all smart contracts on the platform. 
When users write contracts in high-level Cairo, it gets compiled to Sierra, and then to CASM bytecode. The VM receives this bytecode, executes it and generates a proof of execution. This proof is then sent from a sequencer to the verifier to include the transaction in a new block.

## Install

This Virtual Machine is still in development and there is no public release available yet.
Currently, it is only possible to use it by building it from source by following these instructions:

1. Clone the repo to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/cairo-vm-go`.
2. Install `Go` on your PC, instructions [here](https://go.dev/.doc/install).
3. Execute on the root folder of the repo: `make build`.
4. Make sure everything is running smoothly by executing: `make test`.

After completing these steps, you can find the compiled VM in `bin/cairo-vm`.

### Run The VM

To run the VM you need first compile the cairo file using [cairo-lang](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang).
Install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install cairo-lang==0.11
```

The next step is to compile a cairo file, an example would be:

```bash
cairo-compile ./integration_tests/cairo_files/factorial.cairo --proof_mode --output ./factorial_compiled.json
```

This will compile `factorial.cairo` and store the compilation result in `factorial_compiled.json`. The `--proof_mode` flag makes the compilation output special identifiers that allow to get proof of execution later on. Finally, let's execute `factorial_compiled.json` with the next command:

```bash
./bin/cairo-vm run factorial_compiled.json --proofmode --tracefile factorial_trace --memoryfile factorial_memory
```

When this command finishes, `factorial.cairo` has run correctly starting from the `main` function. The `--proofmode` flag indicates that a proof of execution should be generated. The location where this proof is stored is determined by both `--tracefile` and `--memoryfile` flags accordingly.

To test the correct output of the VM compared to the result of the Python VM, you just have to run:

```bash
make integration
```

This will take all Cairo files inside _./integration_tests/cairo_files/_ and run both VMs comparing that both proofs of executions are equal.


### Useful Commands

For convenience, we have created a `makefile` that includes the most used commands such as `make build`. To see all of them please run:
```bash
make help
```

## Documentation

We are planning on writing our documentation soon detailing how we adapt the theory of a non-deterministic machine to a deterministic one. Meanwhile, the next is a list of resources we are currently using to develop the VM.
